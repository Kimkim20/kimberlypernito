            <h2>Education <span>Journey</span></h2>
            <p>     My Education Journey was great because it gained me more a lot of friends from Elementary to College. They give me a lot of memories to cherish this journey with them.
                I started a educational journey in a San Policarpo Central School. I actively participated in
                 extracurricular activities such as  english and music clubs, which enhanced her creativity and social skills.
                 <br>
                 <br>

                 In high school, I attended a public secondary school in San Policarpo National High School where i actively participated a lot of extracurricular activities in school such as dancing, sports(e.g., volleyball and badminton).
                  I also joined a lot of clubs like Math Club, English Club and Science Club where i made a lot of true friends.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                Now that I'm in my College days i enrolled in the course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I want to improve my Skills in Programming and also i want to enhanced my communication skills because since the 
                pandemic started i lost my confident to face the people especially we are being quarantine inside our home. It's a new adjustment that I need to cope since i was immune of staying in my comfort zone.
