        <p>  My hobbies in life is that I enjoy spending time outdoors activies like playing volleyball. Volleyball is a sport that I find both exhilarating and enjoyable. 
            The teamwork, strategy, and physical activity involved in volleyball make it a great way to stay active and socialize.  I also find enjoyment in playing mobile games like Call of Duty Mobile (CODM) 
            and Mobile Legends. These games provide a fun and interactive way to unwind and challenge myself in a virtual setting and it's also fun to have my friends play along with me.
            In my free time, i also have a passion for photography, capturing moments and scenes that inspire me. </p>
